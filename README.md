# Kanban UI

Kanban UI is a web tool used for keeping track of project progress within a company.

## Architecture

For the structure of this project I decided to use class components to create columns, tasks, and a new task form. I utilized props to render multiple columns with unique names and inlcuded a new task form above them that should post to the local mongodb server on submission.

## Usage

Fork and clone this repository and open with a code editor.
